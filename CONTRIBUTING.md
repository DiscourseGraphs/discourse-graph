We appreciate your interest in helping improve [Discourse Graphs](https://github.com/DiscourseGraphs/discourse-graph)! Contributions, whether in code or documentation, are always welcome. ðŸ™Œ

## Start With an Issue

Before diving into a pull request, itâ€™s a good idea to [open an issue](https://github.com/DiscourseGraphs/discourse-graph/issues/new/) to discuss what you have in mind. This ensures your work aligns with the projectâ€™s goals and reduces the chance of duplicating ongoing efforts.

If youâ€™re uncertain about the value of your proposed change, donâ€™t hesitate to create an issue anyway ðŸ˜„. Weâ€™ll review it together, and once we agree on next steps, you can confidently move forward.

## Adding Documentation to the Website

The Discourse Graphs website hosts documentation for both plugins and general information. Here's how to add or edit documentation:

### Blog Posts

Blog posts are located in `/apps/website/app/(home)/blog/posts/`

1. **Create your post file**: Copy `EXAMPLE.md` as a starting template and rename it to your desired URL slug (e.g., `my-new-post.md`)

2. **Required metadata**: Every blog post must start with YAML frontmatter (reference `EXAMPLE.md` for the exact format):
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "Your Post Title"
   date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
   author: "Author's name"
   published: true # Set to true to make the post visible
   ---
   ```

3. **Content**: Write your content below the frontmatter using standard Markdown

### Plugin Documentation

Plugin documentation is organized in `/apps/website/app/(docs)/docs/` with separate folders:
- `/obsidian/pages/` - Obsidian plugin documentation
- `/roam/pages/` - Roam Research extension documentation  
- `/shared/` - Shared configuration files
- `/sharedPages/` - Documentation shared between platforms

1. **Create your documentation file**: Add a new `.md` file in the appropriate platform's `pages/` folder
2. **Use standard Markdown**: No special frontmatter is required for documentation files
3. **Update navigation**: You may need to update the corresponding `navigation.ts` file to include your new page in the sidebar

### Images and Media

All images should be placed in `/apps/website/public/` following this structure:
- **General images**: `/public/` (root level for general website images)
- **Documentation images**: `/public/docs/[platform]/` (e.g., `/public/docs/roam/` for Roam documentation images)
- **Team photos**: `/public/team/`
- **Other assets**: Use appropriate subfolders like `/public/social/`, `/public/supporter-logos/`, etc.

When referencing images in your documentation, use relative paths from the public folder:
```markdown
![Alt text](/docs/roam/my-image.png)
```

### Running the Website Locally

To preview your changes locally:

1. **Environment setup**: Copy `/apps/website/.env.example` to `/apps/website/.env.local` and configure any necessary environment variables
2. **Install dependencies**: Run `npm install` from the project root
3. **Start development server**: Run `npm run dev` or `turbo dev` to start the website locally
4. **View your changes**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see your documentation

The website uses Next.js with the App Router, so changes to Markdown files should be reflected automatically during development.
