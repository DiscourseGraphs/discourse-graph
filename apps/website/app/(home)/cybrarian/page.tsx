          With funding from The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and The Navigation
          Fund, we&apos;re now introducing this structured approach to research
          labs worldwide. Our goal: reduce onboarding time from 3 weeks to 3
          days and build a thriving community of researchers using discourse
          graphs for modular, collaborative science.

          new and existing users, particularly research labs.
