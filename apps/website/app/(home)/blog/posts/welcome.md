The Discourse Graph extension enables [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) users to seamlessly add additional semantic structure to their notes, including specified page types and link types that [model scientific discourse](https://oasis-lab.gitbook.io/roamresearch-discourse-graph-extension/fundamentals/what-is-a-discourse-graph), to enable more complex and structured [knowledge synthesis work](https://oasislab.pubpub.org/pub/54t0y9mk/release/3), such as a complex interdisciplinary literature review, and enhanced collaboration with others on this work.

## Overview

Here is a relatively brief walkthrough of some of the main features of the extension, including creating discourse nodes and relations, and [using](https://oasis-lab.gitbook.io/roamresearch-discourse-graph-extension/guides/exploring-your-discourse-graph), [querying](https://oasis-lab.gitbook.io/roamresearch-discourse-graph-extension/guides/querying-your-discourse-graph), and [sharing](https://oasis-lab.gitbook.io/roamresearch-discourse-graph-extension/guides/sharing-your-discourse-graph) the discourse graph. This is done in the context of an actual ongoing literature review.
