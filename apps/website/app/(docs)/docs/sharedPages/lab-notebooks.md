Lab discourse graphs help research teams to track and share their work. They streamline these parts of your research workflow:
* Organize experiments in a project
* Organize daily work for an experiment
* Capture and revisit key observations for your project
* Put your observations in context with the published literature
* Share initial observations in a group meeting
* Save good ideas and experiments-for-later and revisit them later
* Synthesize your current research into a narrative and next action

Critical features include:
* What's your target question/hypothesis?  Use the target question/hypothesis to assess whether you've finished your experiment/project, or if that cool idea is really on topic
