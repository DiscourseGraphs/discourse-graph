## Opening the Discourse Context

The Discourse Context view is your main tool for exploring relationships between nodes in your graph. There are several ways to open it:

1. Click the telescope icon on the left sidebar

3. Configure a custom hotkey in settings

## Using the Discourse Context

The Discourse Context view shows you:
- All relationships the current node has with other nodes
- Types of relationships (supports, contradicts, etc.)
- Quick access to related nodes
- Tools for creating new relationships

You can use this view to:
- Navigate between related nodes
- Understand how nodes connect to each other
- Add new relationships
- Get a quick overview of your graph structure
