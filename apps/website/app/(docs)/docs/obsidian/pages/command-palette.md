   - "disc node" for node-related commands
   - "disc rel" for relationship commands

2. **Recent Commands**: The Command Palette shows recently used commands first

3. **Fuzzy Search**: The search is fuzzy, so you don't need exact matches
   - "dcn" might find "Discourse Create Node"
   - "drel" might find "Discourse Relationship"

## Customizing Commands

You can customize how commands appear in the Command Palette:

1. Open Obsidian Settings
2. Go to "Hotkeys"
3. Search for "Discourse"
4. Modify the commands or add hotkeys
