# Tagging Candidate Nodes

## Purpose - mark a potential item for later

While you're taking notes, often you'll recognize a potential item to revisit later. Like: "potentially evidence?"

It's helpful to be able to quickly tag these. Later, you can search for them and formalize them with one click.

## Setup - define candidate nodes

In the discourse graphs settings, for each node type, list a "candidate node" tag label:

> ⚠️ Important: A tag cannot use text that is already part of its associated node's format. For example, if the "Claim" node format is CLM, you cannot use #CLM as its tag. You'll get an error message if you attempt to do this.

Tag "candidate nodes" with the keyboard shortcut: ` \ `

Click or use the down arrow key to select a candidate node type.
