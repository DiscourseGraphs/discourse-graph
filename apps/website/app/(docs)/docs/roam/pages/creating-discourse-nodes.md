The extension makes it easy to factor parts of your notes into formal nodes of a discourse graph (claims, evidence, etc.).

Steps to create a discourse graph node:

1. Select the text you want to turn into a formal discourse graph node
2. Press the trigger hotkey (default is `\`) to open up the Node Menu
3. Press the appropriate shortcut key (e.g., E for Evidence)

The system will create a new page with the text as title, appropriate metadata, and template you have defined.

You can customize the template for specific nodes in the Settings Panel.
