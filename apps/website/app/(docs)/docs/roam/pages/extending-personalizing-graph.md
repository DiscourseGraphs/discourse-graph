Some users have extended the grammar quite extensively!

For example, here is a video from a user who extended the grammar to cover structured international law research:

Others have also extended the grammar to integrate with their primary results from their own experiments, to richly contextualize each new result and experiment with questions shared with past research.

Detailed instructions coming soon!

To extend the grammar, it will likely be useful to [learn more about the fundamentals of the extension's grammar and how it works](./grammar).
